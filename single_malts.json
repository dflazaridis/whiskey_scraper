        "description": "A 17-year-old single malt from Craigellachie that was initially matured in a mix of ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks, before half of the mix is finished in first-fill sherry casks and the rest in first-fill bourbon casks. The result is aromas of vanilla, dried pineapple, mango and classic Craigellachie malt that fill the nose, complemented by notes of creamy cereals, vanilla pods, black liquorice and charred oak throughout the palate and lingering in the finish.",
